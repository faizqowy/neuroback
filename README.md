# NeuroBack: Improving CDCL SAT Solving using Graph Neural Networks (ICLR'24)

### Status: Under Construction ðŸš§

Thank you for showing interest in our **NeuroBack** project. We are pleased to announce the release of the **DataBack** dataset on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neuroback/DataBack), which consists of 120,286 SAT formulas in CNF format with the phases of their backbone variables. We are also diligently preparing the source code for release at the earliest opportunity.
